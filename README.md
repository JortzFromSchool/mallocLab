15-213 mallocLab

My implementation of malloc in C, completed for CMU's famous (or infamous, depending on how you look at it) 15-213, or, Introduction to Computer Systems. The implementation utilizes explicit listing for managing free blocks, bundled coalescing and splitting, and a find fit / best fit hybrid search for locating suitable blocks. My version of malloc scored a 109 out of a possible 120 points.
My mallocLab is currently only available upon request for potential employers or others with a valid reason to view it, as posting a solution in public forum such as this would violate CMU's academic integrity policy. If this is the case, contact me personally and I will be happy to provide it.
